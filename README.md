# Introduction to Network Analysis Using Python's Networkx Library

**Author**: Haiko Lietz, GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences

**Version**: 13 July 2018

**Description**: This is an introduction to network analysis in Python using version 2.1 of the networkx library. networkx is not suited for large networks, but it's part of the standard Anaconda installation and therefore easy to install, it's frequently extended and has a large user community. For large networks, consider graph-tool or igraph. Consult this paper for a comparison of these packages and why Python is good for scientific computing. If you're looking for another introduction into networkx, try the official tutorial.
