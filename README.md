**Description**: This is an introduction to network analysis in Python using version 2.1 of the <a href='https://networkx.github.io/'>networkx</a> library. *networkx* is not suited for large networks, but it's part of the standard Anaconda installation and therefore easy to install, it's frequently extended and has a large user community. For large networks, consider <a href='https://graph-tool.skewed.de/'>graph-tool</a> or <a href='http://igraph.org/python/'>igraph</a>. Consult <a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/2059799115622763'>this paper</a> for a comparison of these packages and why Python is good for scientific computing.
